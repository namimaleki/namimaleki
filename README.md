## About Me

### 🎓 Education
Computer Engineering and Mathematics  
University of British Columbia  
Expected Graduation: 2027

### 💡 Interests
I'm an ambitious and driven student who thrives on intellectual challenges and solving complex problems. My passion for understanding how things work at a fundamental level led me to pursue both computer engineering and mathematics. I'm constantly pushing myself to explore difficult concepts and expand my knowledge across multiple disciplines.

I'm particularly fascinated by robotics, machine learning, physics, and game theory. Beyond academics, I enjoy playing basketball, soccer, and volleyball. I push myself physically through running and weight lifting, and in my free time, I enjoy reading, playing chess, and spending time with friends and family.
